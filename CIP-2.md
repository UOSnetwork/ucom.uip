Improve user mention UI
-----

When you want to mention a user (@someone), it could be difficult to find the user account name.
I suggest 3 things:
- Be able to search by username
- Order the list in a more clever way than alphabetically (ex: author, people that have answered, then other users)
- Display the account name when you hover a user with the mouse

Impact
-------

Easier and faster way to mention users in posts.
